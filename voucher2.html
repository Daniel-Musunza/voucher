                    <p> This is an important document. You should retain this as you will need it if your travel
                        arrangements are protected under a
                        scheme of financial protection and you need to make a claim. You have booked an ATOL protected

                        from us and your ATOL certificate is included at the end of this document. This lists what is
                        financially protected, where you
                        can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong</p>

                        Therefore, we have taken
                        measures to provide insolvency protection with International Passenger Protection Limited (IPP)

                <div class="your-bags-info">

                    <p> Everyone can bring on board one small cabin bag per person for free, which must fit under the
                        seat in front of you. It can be
                        no bigger than 45 x 36 x 20 cm including wheels and handles.</p>
                    <p> A standard hold bag, included per person on all easyJet holidays (expect for infants), is up to
                        23kg. If you’re travelling with
                        family or friends on the same flight and booking, you can pool your total weight allowance. No
                        single item can weigh more
                        than 32kg. Maximum total size (length + width + height) = under 275cm.</p>

                    <p>If you’d like to bring any additional luggage, such as a large overhead cabin bag (max 56 x 45 x
                        25 cm including wheels and
                        handles), any extra hold bags or add any weight to your luggage, you’re able to book this,
                        subject to availability, as soon as
                        you have your flight reference number starting with a K or when you check in for your flights
                        from 30 days before departure.</p>
